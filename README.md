## Description of Application
This application is a work day planner that allows the user to schedule out events in a work day. The user is presented with time blocks representing hours between 9AM and 5PM. The user can type events into each text area (or "time block") and click a save button on the right side of the block to save the events in that particular block. Upon saving, the text will be stored in local storage and will be retained on refresh. Additionally, this application uses moment.js to display today's date at the top of the page. Also, the colors of the blocks correspond to whether that hour of the day has passed, is ongoing, or has yet to come. Moment.js is used to update these as well. The colors and date update on refresh and when a save button is clicked.
